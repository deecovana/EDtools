Fonts
=====

The overlay bundles Source Sans 3 (Google Fonts) under the SIL Open Font
License 1.1 via `SourceSans3-Regular.ttf`. The license text is provided in
`SourceSans3-OFL.txt`. It also ships Google’s Noto Color Emoji under the same
license (`NotoColorEmoji.ttf` + `NotoColorEmoji-OFL.txt`) so emoji glyphs are
available out of the box.

If you prefer to override the HUD font, drop alternative font files in this
directory. For example, you can download the Elite: Dangerous cockpit font from
https://github.com/inorton/EDMCOverlay/blob/master/EDMCOverlay/EDMCOverlay/EUROCAPS.TTF,
save it here as `Eurocaps.ttf`, and include the original license text if
available. The client looks for filenames case-insensitively, so the file can be
named in any case.

To control load order, list one filename per line in `preferred_fonts.txt`. The
first entry that loads successfully becomes the active font, followed by the
bundled Source Sans 3 and any other fonts present, and finally the system
default if nothing else works.

Emoji or symbol fonts can be layered on top of your primary HUD font by adding
them to `emoji_fallbacks.txt`. Each line can reference a font file stored in
this directory (for example, `NotoColorEmoji.ttf`) or an installed family name
such as `Segoe UI Emoji`. Entries are consulted in order; the first available
font that contains a requested glyph will be used for rendering.
